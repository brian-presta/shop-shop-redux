# shop-shop-redux
This project is a practice project refactoring [another practice project](https://github.com/brian-presta/shop-shop) of mine to use Redux instead of React's Context API for state management. shop-shop is a e-commerce site built with the MERN stack that uses [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/) API sandbox to simulate checking out.
